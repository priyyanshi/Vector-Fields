## Process:

I had used similar visualizers when taking Calculus III, and was eager to build one myself with a more intuitive UI than the ones I used. Through the project I was able to learn:
*	To use and familiarize myself with the p5.js libraryâ€™s 3D (WEBGL) renderer.
*	To parse the user input using Math.js library.
